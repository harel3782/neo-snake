🐍 Neo-Snake Portfolio Edition

A modern, cyberpunk-themed Snake game built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates state management, side-effects handling (useEffect), and responsive design patterns in a functional React component architecture.

🌟 Features

React Hooks: Uses useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback for game loop logic.

Input Buffering: Implements a move queue system to prevent "suicide turns" (a common bug in simple snake games).

Persistence: Saves High Scores to localStorage.

Responsive Design: Includes touch controls (D-Pad) for mobile devices and keyboard support (WASD/Arrows) for desktop.

Dynamic Themes: Switch between Matrix Green, Cyber Blue, Synth Purple, and Magma Orange.

Polished UI: Neon glow effects and smooth transitions using Tailwind CSS.
